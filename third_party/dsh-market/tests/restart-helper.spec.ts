/**
 * The detached restart helper, tested by RUNNING it.
 *
 * #177: on Windows the helper slept a flat 1500ms, spawned the replacement,
 * and swallowed the result. The old process had exited but its listening
 * socket had not been released, so the replacement died instantly with
 * EADDRINUSE and nothing was written anywhere — the restart button appeared
 * to do nothing, every time.
 *
 * Every piece of that helper read correctly on its own, which is why this
 * spec starts a real server, holds the port, and runs the real helper source
 * against it. Asserting on the generated string would only prove the string
 * contains the words.
